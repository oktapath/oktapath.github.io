__Why Open-source?__ What does open-source mean?

> **Open Source** software means that the source code of the software project is publicly and freely available, that is, it can be viewed, modified and used by third parties.

Open Source does not mean it’s free, but many Open Source technologies are available free of charge, in some cases Enterprise versions with extended features and support are offered.

There are many reasons for embracing Open source we have listed a few of our favourites below.

1. Community: Fast and continuous development of the software by the community.
2. Quality & Reliability According to surveys, Open Source stands for proven, reliable and high-quality software.
3. Transparency: Open source code means just that—you get full visibility into the code base, as well as all discussions about how the community develops features and addresses bugs.
4. Flexibility & Adaptability: Open Source software can be customized to meet individual needs.
5. Security: High security standards, security gaps are closed more rapidly.

## Why are we embracing it

**Simple!** To help you accelerate into the cloud by leveraging our experience, experience we are pouring into our open source libraries and packages.

### What can you expect

We hope to cover Infrastructure as Code (IaC), common security concerns and the SDLC enablers like testing packages. We will also create helper packages for dealing with everyday tasks in Azure

We hope to be able to generate multiple projects that cover many day to day scenarios such as:

- Packages that deal with everyday issues in code.
- Infrastructure as code to build your favorite platforms such as Kubernetes etc.
- YAML that will build pipelines in Azure Devops.
- Packages to abstract security, while applying best practice.
- Best Practice Angular templates to create UIs with the click of a button.

### Where will you find the code

Simple you will see all our public code on our GitHub account.
