__Why is tooling important?__ This is one of the most common questions we get asked. Our answer is this:

> good tooling and the right setup influence behaviour for the better.

Tooling helps to create a pattern of engagement and a mindset that can be very beneficial to a developer.

Consider a carpenter working with tools from a mechanic. His experience will be poor, and his quality of work will suffer greatly. This is a scenario that replays itself in alsmost every technology business.

We will cover a range of tools for working with .Net alongside with Azure and Azure DevOps.

## __The Integrated Development Environment (IDE)__

## Visual Studio

The main IDE we normally use is Visual Studio. There are 3 main distributions: [Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16), [Professional](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Professional&rel=16) and [Enterprise](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Enterprise&rel=16). Community is a stripped down version, but Professional and Enterprise are close enough, the big difference being enterprise as the profilers, including Intellitrace, which can be very handy in certain debug scenarios.

Optionally you can use the [Visual Studio preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/) that in return for giving the Visual Studio product teams feedback, you get to use any edition for free.

### Extensions

Here's a list of the main extensions we use daily:

- __[R#](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)__ - we buy the ultimate version, because it comes bundled with a set of profilers that are great for your toolkit

- __[Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/visual-studio)__ - best time tracker for Visual Studio, allows you to keep track of your hands-on time and through what languages are you spending your time on

## Visual Studio Code

Another IDE we use almost as often as Visual Studio side by side is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Because it's the largest open source project in the world, it contains several extensions and features that make it a better IDE for certain coding tasks: Markdown, Azure ARM Templates, Terraform, etc. It's also of note that it's a free, open source, IDE.
